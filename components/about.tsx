            With experience in AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and DevOps practices, 
            combined with my skills in the MERN stack, I create user-focused, responsive, and efficient digital experiences. 
            What started as curiosity about how the web works has grown into a journey of solving real-world problems with technology.

            I believe in writing clean code, designing intuitive interfaces, 
            and continuously learning to stay ahead in the tech world. When I am not coding, I am usually exploring new cloud-native tools, 
            experimenting with side projects related to AWS, CI/CD, Docker and Kubernetes.
